# Unpaired-Image-to-Image-Translation-using-Cycle-Consistent-Adversarial-Networks
This project implements CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation method. Leveraging GANs and cycle-consistency, it converts images from one domain to another (e.g., horses ↔ zebras, summer ↔ winter) without requiring paired images.
